Parvazhub project was started at april 2017. I left my job at the time and I was looking for a project that I can build from the scratch. The kind of project which does not need any real world activities (like someone answer the phone or send packages), a total digital project/businuess. In my last job we had this excel sheet that compares the flight prices of online travel agencies. It was a minor issue and we generated the data one time in a year maybe. <br>
Then I though about two questions. Is it hard to build a service like Skyscanner? Is it possible to make it profitable? The answer to second question is yes. And answer to first one is not only it's not hard but it is enjoyable if you love to create.
